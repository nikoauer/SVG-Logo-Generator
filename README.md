# <SCG-Logo-Generator>

## Description

This project offered me a better understanding of how to utilize constructors and modularization. I believe on a larger scale, the use of constructors would be very useful for handling larger inputs of data but in this instance it was useful to understand how it can be used as a blueprint for data input. Furthermore the modularization of functions and files helped me to better understand and utilize small manageable modules of code to fulfil a larger goal.

This project also helped me better understand how I can implement testing tools such as jest to assess the parameters of my code. I also came to rudimentaly understand the basic structure of scg files which was also interesting.


## Installation

In order to run this program you require:

- Some kind of code editor with an intergrated terminal (such as VS Code)
- npm inquirer
- npm jest
- SVG extension to visualize the svg file output

## Usage

In order to run this program, clone this repository and open it in a code editor. Open a integrated terminal and proceed to npm install inquirer (npm i inquirer) and jest (npm i jest) if are already installed. Now in the CLI type "node index.js", 4 questions will then prompt the user for the 3 characters they want in their logo, their colour, the shape and the shape colour. Once answered it will then notify the user that a logo has been geneterated and should be accessable in the output folder.
